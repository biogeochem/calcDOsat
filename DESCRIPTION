Description: This function allows you to calculate dissolved oxygen from USGS Technical Memorandum 2011.03. Input a dataframe with the measured dissolved oxygen concentration (mg/L), water temperature (C), atmospheric pressure (kPa), and specific conductance (optional; uS/cm) and choose from 3 methods (Weiss, Benson-Krause, or Garcia-Gordon) to calculate your DO as a %-saturation.
